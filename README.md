## Description

This project consists on a Hospital appointment scheduling system. 
Patients can enter their symptoms or required specialization (e.g., cardiology, surgery), and the system will find the nearest available appointment date with a doctor of the specified specialization. 

The system should consider doctor availability, patient load, and appointment duration.
